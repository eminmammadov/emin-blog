Managing subscription lifecycles in enterprise applications presents unique challenges that go well beyond simple recurring billing. As organizations scale, they need robust systems that can handle complex scenarios like mid-cycle plan changes, usage-based billing adjustments, and synchronized updates across multiple services.

In this post, we'll explore a sample architecture that uses AWS services to create a reliable and scalable subscription management system.

## The challenge of enterprise subscription management

Enterprise subscription management is fundamentally different from basic recurring billing. Consider a scenario where a customer wants to upgrade their plan mid-billing cycle. This seemingly simple operation triggers a cascade of requirements:

* The billing system needs to calculate prorated charges for both the old and new plans.
* All associated services need to be updated to reflect new entitlements.
* Usage data needs to be migrated or adjusted according to the new plan rules.
* The customer needs to be notified of changes and provided with updated documentation.
